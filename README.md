## Hi there 👋

From crafting intricate lines of Python to analyzing complex data sets, my transition from a solid Computer Science background to the dynamic realm of Machine Learning has been fueled by a passion for data-driven decision-making. My career is driven by curiosity about the transformative power of technology and its potential to advance strategic solutions.

I’m particularly inspired by the ability of machine learning to revolutionize industries and improve lives. This led me to pursue a Data Science diploma at BrainStation, where I refined my skills in Python, SQL, Tableau, and key machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch. My work includes developing the Little Lemon App 🍋 and predictive models that evaluate managerial impact on football teams ⚽.

I specialize in combining data visualization 📊 with machine learning 🤖 to create actionable insights, a strength demonstrated through projects such as the Octopus Energy Industry Project 🌍 and Football Managerial Impact analysis. My goal is to contribute to teams that value forward-thinking solutions, while remaining at the forefront of the machine learning field.

Feel free to connect with me to explore how my analytical skills and passion for tech can help elevate your data-driven projects. Let’s collaborate to transform insights into impact!
